<h3 align="center">The Process of getting Coursera-Finantial-Aid</h3>
<p><h2>Annual Income= 0$</h2></p>
<p><h2>Employment status= Student</h2></p>

<h3>Reason you applied for aid</h3>
<p>
Hello, my name is(________), and I live in Bangladesh, a developing country. I'm applying for financial aid for the course "____________". Because I do not have any special source of income, I don't earn enough money, and I can't afford the full tuition at this time in my life and career. Receiving financial aid for this course will help me gain valuable knowledge for my programming career. I have been searching for a job for a long time to earn money for taking this course, and I have not yet found one. As time goes on, receiving financial aid will allow me to focus on my studies and, by taking it, allow me to take off for a paid internship and take another course in (_________) sectors. I want to invest in my career and my education, but at this moment I can only invest my time to increase my knowledge and advance in my career, not my money. Hopefully, this will change in the upcoming years because I'm ambitious, I want to increase my programming knowledge and learn new technologies, and I'm eager to work and advance in my career.
</p>

<p><h2>Amount you can pay= 0$ </h2></p>

<h3>Course goals</h3>
<p>
  My major professional objective is to continue to learn. I sincerely desire to learn new things and advance in my work. Programming calls for ongoing learning and development. I may increase my understanding of ____NLP____ by enrolling in the course "_____Course Name_____". I've recently encountered clouds a couple of times. The more I can learn about AI, the better, as it seems to be a common technology tool today. By enrolling in these courses, I will really be more prepared for the job market once I am offered a position to manage in a similar industry; not only will I receive the certification, but I will also gain the knowledge and practical experience necessary to perform the job. After finishing these programs, I think I'll be able to work as a ___NLP___ Engineer who can use the majority of AI based technologies and benefit from the on-the-job training this certification will offer.
